*Description*: Scripts for data acquisition, data manipulation, statistical modeling, results post-processing, and accuracy assessment for the quantitative mapping of vegetation in North American Beringia.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to run scripts to map continuous foliar cover of vegetation species or aggregates in North American Beringia (or other regions with modification). The scripts integrate multiple systems: Google Earth Engine, Python-based ArcGIS Pro, Python, R, and Google Cloud Compute. The scripts that have dependencies on ArcGIS Pro must be run on windows based machines, all other scripts are platform independent. Reproducing the results will require proper execution of all scripts. Scripts can be modified to apply to other data or study regions. Detailed instructions for each script have been included in this readme file below. Vegetation and soils observation data used for these analyses are stored in and were queried from a public, open-source [vegetation plots database](https://github.com/accs-uaa/vegetation-plots-database).

6. *Optional*: Configure access to Google Cloud Compute Engine (or another provisioner of cloud computational resources) and set up virtual machines. Instructions for setting up virtual machines are included in the "cloudCompute" folder of this repository. For more information on configuring Google Cloud Compute Engine, see: https://cloud.google.com/compute/.

## Usage

This section describes the purpose of each script and gives instructions for modifying parameters to reproduce results or adapt to another project.

### 1. Data Acquisition

#### 1.1. Calculate Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Composites

The Earth Engine script produces median composites using ascending orbitals for the VV and VH polarizations from Sentinel-1. Composites are calculated from median values across growing season months June, July, and August from 2015 through 2019. See the Google Earth Engine Sentinel-1 SAR GRD page for more information about the source data: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD.

Script is located in (..data_Reflectance/sentinel1):

​	sentinel1_vv_vh.js

#### 1.2. Calculate Sentinel-2 Spectral Composites

The Earth Engine scripts calculate and export cloud-reduced, maximum-NDVI composites for Sentinel-2 bands 2-8a and 11-12 plus the following derived metrics: enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI-2), normalized burn ratio (NBR), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference snow index (NDSI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Because the North American Beringia study region includes latitudes greater than 65° N, all composites are calculated from the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) image collections. These scripts can be modified to calculate composites from surface reflectance image collections for study regions that are below 65° N. Composites are calculated individually for the months of May-September from years 2015-2019. See Chander et al. 2009 for a description of the TOA reflectance method. See the Google Earth Engine Sentinel-2 page for more information about the source data: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2.

​	cloudlessSentinel2_06June.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_07July.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_09September.js

**Instructions for Google Earth Engine:**

* In the [Google Earth Engine code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), paste the monthly earth engine script into the javascript window. You can optionally modify and save the script in a git repository within Google Earth Engine.

* Run the script. The results can be inspected in the map window (shows a natural color blue-green-red image), in the inspector, and in the console.
* Each image must be exported to a Google Drive folder (or other Google storage option) by clicking the "Run" button. The export requires a large amount of available storage in the Google Drive (over 10 TB) and can take several days to weeks to process.
* Download the imagery from the Google storage to a local directory (see the script "DataDownload_Sentinel2.py").

#### 1.3. Calculate MODIS Mean Land Surface Temperature

The Earth Engine script calculates decadal monthly mean land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS Terra data collected from 2010 to 2019 (the 2010s decade) for the months May-September. All calculations are made from the 8-day, rather than daily, MODIS product. See the Google Earth Engine MODIS LST 8-Day page for more information about the source data: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD11A2.

Script is located in (../data_Reflectance/modis_lst):

​	modisLST_2010s_May-September.js

**Instructions for Google Earth Engine:**

* In the [Google Earth Engine code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), paste the earth engine script into the Javascript window. You can optionally modify and save the script in a git repository within Google Earth Engine.
* Run the script. The results can be inspected in the map window (shows a false color LST image), in the inspector, and in the console.
* Each image must be exported to a Google Drive folder (or other Google storage option) by clicking the "Run" button.
* Download the imagery from the Google storage to a local directory (see the script "DataDownload_lstMODIS.py").

### 8. Prepare Data for Prediction

#### 8.1. Extract Predictor Data to Study Area

In cases where the area of interest and study area are different, the predictor rasters developed using the above scripts must be formatted to match the extent of the study area. The study area should be a raster with the same grid and cell size as the area of interest but with an extent that matches the area of input observations and output predictions. This ArcGIS Pro Python script extracts a set of predictor datasets for specified grids to a study area to enforce the same extent on all rasters.

### 8. Prepare Vegetation Observations



### 9. Prepare Soils Observations



# Packages

This section describes the packages and functions designed for the analysis of Beringian vegetation and soils. The scripts included in this section cannot be run directly. Input and output parameters for running scripts are described in the "Usage" section above.

### 1. Geomorphometry

The Geomorphometry package includes scripts to calculate topographic properties from a DEM. All scripts in the Geomorphometry package are adapted from the [Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox 2.0](https://github.com/jeffreyevans/GradientMetrics) (Evans et al. 2014) and based on the gradient surface metrics described by Cushman et al. (2010).

#### 1.1. Compound Topographic

This function calculates compound topographic index, a quantification of catenary landscape position that serves as an index of steady state wetness (Gessler et al. 1995).
