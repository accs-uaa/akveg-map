*Author*: Timm Nawrocki, Alaska Center for Conservation Science, University of Alaska Anchorage

*Created On*: 2019-10-22

*Last Updated*: 2020-01-09

*Description*: Scripts for the data aquisition, data manipulation, statistical modeling, results post-processing, and other analyses for the quantitative mapping of vegetation and soils properties in North American Beringia.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to run the Beringian Vegetation Ecological Atlas scripts. The scripts integrate multiple systems: PostGreSQL database, Google Earth Engine, python-based ArcGIS Pro, Python, R, and Google Cloud Compute. The scripts that have dependencies on ArcGIS Pro must be run on windows based machines, all other scripts are platform independent. Reproducing the results will require proper execution of all scripts. Scripts can be modified to apply to other data or study regions. Detailed instructions for each script have been included in this readme file below.

   , and 

   [R]: https://www.r-project.org/

    in a local environment according to the documentation provided by the originators.

2. In ArcGIS Pro, select the python management option. Using the conda install option, install the most recent version of psycopg2.
3. Download or clone this repository to a folder on a drive accessible to your machine. Local drives may perform better than network drives. The structure and names of files and folders within the repository should not be altered.
4. In order to query a local version of the Alaska Vegetation Plots Database, set up a PostGreSQL server and create a local instance of the database. For more information, see: https://github.com/accs-uaa/vegetation-plots-database.
5. Configure access to Google Earth Engine and an appropriate Google data storage option that can be associated with Google Earth Engine. For more information, see: https://earthengine.google.com/.
6. *Optional*: Configure access to Google Cloud Compute Engine (or another provisioner of cloud computational resources) and set up virtual machines. Instructions for setting up virtual machines are included in the "cloudCompute" folder of this repository. For more information on configuring Google Cloud Compute Engine, see: https://cloud.google.com/compute/.

## Usage

This section describes the purpose of each script and gives instructions for modifying parameters to reproduce results or adapt to another project.

### 1. Data Acquisition

#### 1.1. Calculate Sentinel-2 Spectral Composites

The Earth Engine scripts calculate and export cloud-reduced, maximum-NDVI composites for Sentinel-2 bands 2-8a and 11-12 plus the following derived metrics: enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI-2), normalized burn ratio (NBR), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference snow index (NDSI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Because the North American Beringia study region includes latitudes greater than 65° N, all composites are calculated from the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) image collections. These scripts can be modified to calculate composites from surface reflectance image collections for study regions that are below 65° N. Composites are calculated individually for the months of May-September from years 2015-2019. See Chander et al. 2009 for a description of the TOA reflectance method. See the Google Earth Engine Sentinel-2 page for more information about the source data: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2.

Scripts are located in (../data_Reflectance/sentinel2):

​	cloudlessSentinel2_05May.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_06June.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_07July.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_08August.js

​	cloudlessSentinel2_09September.js

**Instructions for Google Earth Engine:**

* In the 

  [Google Earth Engine code editor]: https://code.earthengine.google.com/

  , paste the monthly earth engine script into the javascript window. You can optionally modify and save the script in a git repository within Google Earth Engine.

* Run the script. The results can be inspected in the map window (shows a natural color blue-green-red image), in the inspector, and in the console.
* Each image must be exported to a Google Drive folder (or other Google storage option) by clicking the "Run" button. The export requires a large amount of available storage in the Google Drive (over 10 TB) and can take several days to weeks to process.
* Download the imagery from the Google storage to a local directory (see the script "DataDownload_Sentinel2.py").

#### 1.2. Calculate MODIS Mean Land Surface Temperature

The Earth Engine script calculates decadal monthly mean land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS Terra data collected from 2010 to 2019 (the 2010s decade) for the months May-September. All calculations are made from the 8-day, rather than daily, MODIS product. See the Google Earth Engine MODIS LST 8-Day page for more information about the source data: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD11A2.

# Packages

This section describes the packages and functions designed for the analysis of Beringian vegetation and soils. The scripts included in this section cannot be run directly. Input and output parameters are for running scripts are described in the "Usage" section above.

### 1. Geomorphometry

The Geomorphometry package includes scripts to calculate topographic properties from a DEM. All scripts in the Geomorphometry package are adapted from the 

[Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox 2.0]: https://github.com/jeffreyevans/GradientMetrics

 (Evans et al. 2014) and based on the gradient surface metrics described by Cushman et al. (2010).

#### 1.1. Compound Topographic

This function calculates compound topographic index, a quantification of catenary landscape position that serves as an index of steady state wetness (Gessler et al. 1995).
