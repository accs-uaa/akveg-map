# Initialization for Geomorphometry Module
# Author: Timm Nawrocki
# Last Updated: 2019-12-07
# Usage: Individual functions have varying requirements. All functions that use arcpy must be executed in an ArcGIS Pro Python 3.6 distribution.
# Description: This initialization file imports modules in the package so that the contents are accessible. The functions in this package are adapted from Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox 2.0 by Jeff Evans and Jim Oakleaf (2014) available at https://github.com/jeffreyevans/GradientMetrics
