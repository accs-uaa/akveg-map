  "name": "alder shrubs",
  "rationale": "LightGBM provided the best quantitative performance.",
  "description": "The alder shrubs diagnostic species set consists of all <i>Alnus</i> taxa that occur in Alaska and Yukon (see species list below), except <i>Alnus rubra</i> Bong (because that species exhibits a tree growth form). Alder shrubs are widespread throughout the map domain, except the northernmost portion of the Arctic Northern vegetation region and the central and western Aleutian Islands. Despite being absent from many of the Aleutian Islands, alder shrubs become common again in Kamchatka, part of the Aleutian-Kamchatka vegetation region (but not included in the map domain). While alder shrubs are widespread in the map domain, they achieve the highest abundance along mountain slopes in the Alaska Pacific, Alaska-Yukon Southern, and Alaska Southwest vegetation regions. They are also common along floodplains and riparian corridors of the boreal bioclimatic zone. The species epitaphs <i>viridis</i> and <i>crispa</i> are likely familiar from use in Alaska. The name <i>alnobetula</i>, however, has priority over <i>viridis</i> (Greuter and von Raab-Straube 2011). <i>Alnus crispa</i> (Dryl. ex Aiton) Pursh has been frequently misapplied within Alaska for <i>Alnus alnobetula</i> ssp. <i>fruticosa</i> (Rupr.) Raus.",
