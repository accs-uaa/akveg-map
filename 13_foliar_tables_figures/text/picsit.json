  "name": "Sitka spruce",
  "rationale": "Random Forests best matched the range limitations of Sitka spruce along the coast of the Kenai Peninsula.",
  "description": "The Sitka spruce diagnostic species set consists only of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Bong.) Carrière. The area where <i>Picea sitchensis</i> is common and widespread helps define the Alaska Pacific vegetation region as distinct from Alaska-Yukon Southern or Alaska Southwest (see Appendix S3) because it is closely associated with wet coastal temperate rainforest. Several small, sporadic clusters of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> also occur on the west side of Cook Inlet and down the southern (Pacific) coast of the Alaska Peninsula. <i>Picea sitchensis</i> is one parent of the hybrid <i>Picea ×lutzii</i> Little; the other parent is <i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss. We included <i>Picea ×lutzii</i> within the  white spruce diagnostic species set because it occupies well-drained sites that receive less annual precipitation than typical for <i>Picea sitchensis</i>. In the Kenai Mountains, where both species occur, <i>Picea sitchensis</i> is common in the immediate vicinity of the Pacific Coast (e.g., Seward) while <i>Picea ×lutzii</i> is common in the interior of the mountains (e.g., Cooper Landing).",
