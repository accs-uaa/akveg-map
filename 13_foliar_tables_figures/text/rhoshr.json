  "description": "The <i>Rhododendron</i> shrubs diagnostic species set consists of all <i>Rhododendron</i> taxa that occur in Alaska and Yukon with typical growth form less than 1 m tall (see species list below). <i>Rhododendron</i> shrubs are common and widespread throughout the map domain, except the central and eastern Aleutian Islands. We do not include <i>Rhododendron menziesii</i> Craven (formerly known as <i>Menziesia ferruginea</i> Sm.) because it typically grows in coastal rainforests and exhibits a taller growth habit, being generally taller than 1 m. Some of the <i>Rhododendron</i> taxa that occur in Alaska have been commonly known under the genus <i>Ledum</i> in the past.",
