  "rationale": "LightGBM provided the best quantitative performance. We removed the summer warmth and January minimum temperature covariates because of visible artifacts associated with the coarse resolution of those data.",
  "description": "The needleleaf ericaceous shrubs diagnostic species set consists of dwarf shrubs in the family Ericaceae that have persistent, needle-shaped leaves (see species list below). These species typically have prostrate, spreading growth forms and develop low mats. <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> is included within this diagnostic species set, in addition to being mapped independently. Needleleaf ericaceous shrubs are common and widespread throughout the map domain.",
