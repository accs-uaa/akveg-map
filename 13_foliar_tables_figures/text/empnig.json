  "name": "crowberry",
  "rationale": "LightGBM provided the best quantitative performance. We removed the summer warmth and January minimum temperature covariates because of visible artifacts associated with the coarse resolution of those data.",
  "description": "The crowberry diagnostic species set consists only of <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> L. <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> is common and widespread throughout the map domain. Although we also included this species within the needleleaf ericaceous shrubs diagnostic species set, we mapped <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> independently to represent communities where it dominates or co-dominates, especially in the Aleutian-Kamchatka vegetation region.",
