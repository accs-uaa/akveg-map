  "rationale": "LightGBM provided the best quantitative performance. We removed all climate covariates because of visible artifacts associated with the coarse resolution of those data.",
  "description": "The <i>Dryas</i> dwarf shrubs diagnostic species set consists only of all taxa in the genus <i>Dryas</i> that occur in Alaska and Yukon. <i>Dryas</i> dwarf shrubs are common throughout the map domain, except the Aleutian Islands. They occupy progressively wider topographic bands moving from the warmer and wetter portions of the map domain to the colder and dryer portions. In the temperate bioclimatic zone, <i>Dryas</i> dwarf shrubs are often dominant in high alpine areas. In the boreal bioclimatic zone, <i>Dryas</i> dwarf shrubs are common in alpine areas, near treeline, and on floodplains (<i>Dryas drummondii</i> Richardson ex Hook.). In the Arctic, <i>Dryas</i> dwarf shrubs occur in all but the highest elevations, where vegetation is generally absent. Separating individual species can be challenging as several of the species introgress. In the past, <i>Dryas octopetala</i> has been applied as a catch-all name for much of the variation in <i>Dryas</i> found in Alaska and Yukon. We follow a taxonomic solution whereby <i>Dryas octopetala</i> does not occur in northwestern North America.",
