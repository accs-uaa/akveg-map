  "description": "The birch trees diagnostic species set consists of all broadleaf deciduous trees in Alaska and Yukon (see species list below). By limiting inclusion to broadleaf trees, this set excludes <i>Larix laricina</i> (Du Roi) K. Koch, which is a needleleaf deciduous tree. Broadleaf trees are common throughout the boreal and temperate bioclimatic zones, but also occur in small, sporadic clusters in the several places in the Arctic (<i>Populus balsamifera</i> L.; Breen 2014). The map domain does not currently extend into Southeast Alaska (as of version 2.x) where <i>Alnus rubra</i> Bong. would be added to the species list.",
